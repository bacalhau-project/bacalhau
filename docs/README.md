## OpenAPI

OpenAPI v2 annotations sit by the endpoints in `pkg/publicapi`; these are built using [swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag), a Go converter for Swagger documentation.
Find more details about the Swag annotations [in their docs](https://github.com/swaggo/swag#declarative-comments-format).
The swagger specification is built automatically by the CI pipeline (see the `build_swagger` workflow) but you can trigger a local build with `make swagger-docs`.

The build parses the OpenAPI annotations as well as the markdown files in `docs/swagger/` (containing  long-form descriptions of the API endpoints), and generates the following swagger specification files:

* `docs/docs.go`
* `docs/swagger.json`
* `docs/swagger.yaml`

Note that the CI pipeline will open and automatically merge a pull request titled `[circleci] Build swagger reference - this is an automatic commit ...` containing *only* the updated spec files. 

## Python Libraries

We ship 2 python Bacalhau libraries:

* `bacalhau-apiclient` wraps *only* the API endpoint calls and request/response models. It's autogenerated from the OpenAPI specification (see paragraph above). Read more about it in its [readme](../clients/README.md).
* `bacalhau-sdk` is a **high-level** Bacalhau SDK that ships all the client-side logic (e.g. signing requests) needed to query the endpoints. Its [examples folder](python/examples) contains code snippets to create, list and inspect jobs. Under the hood, it uses the `bacalhau-apiclient` to call the API. Please use this library in your projects. Read more about it in its [readme](../python/README.md).
