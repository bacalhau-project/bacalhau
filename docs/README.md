## Develop docs locally
Follow these simple example steps to get a local version of the site up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Git ([Installation instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)), for version control.
- Node.js and `npm` ([Installation instructions](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html)), to run the static site generator [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) used to build this website.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau
cd ./bacalhau/docs
yarn install
```

### Render website

```
yarn run start
```
The rendered site will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/

## Documentation structure
`docs/` : This is where all the .md files live that control the content of this site. Most contributions happen in this directory.

**Note**: All [code examples](https://docs.bacalhau.org/examples/) live in a dedicated repository https://github.com/bacalhau-project/examples and they are automagically rendered into the [./docs/examples/](./docs/examples) folder by github actions.

## Contributing
We would [**love ‚ù§Ô∏è your help**](./contributing.md) to improve existing items or make new ones even better!

### Issues and Pull requests
If you find any inconsistencies in the docs, please raise an issue [here ‚Üí](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/issues). Feel free to also submit a pull request with any changes you'd like to see to this repo. Every contribution is more than welcome! üéà
