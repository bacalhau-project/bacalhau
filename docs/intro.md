## Overview

Bacalhau is a platform for fast, cost efficient, and secure computation by running jobs where the data is generated and stored. With Bacalhau, you can streamline your exisiting workflows without the need of extensive rewriting by running  arbitrary Docker containers and WebAssembly (wasm) images as tasks. This architecture is also referred to as **Compute Over Data** (or CoD). _[Bacalhau](https://translate.google.com/?sl=pt&tl=en&text=bacalhau&op=translate) was coined from the Portuguese word for salted Cod fish_.  **At the moment we are free volunteer network, enjoy;)**

## Why Bacalhau?

⚡️ **Process jobs fast**: Jobs in Bacalhau are processed where the data was created and all jobs are parallel by default.

💸 **Low cost:** Reduce (or eliminate) ingress/egress costs since jobs are processed closer to the source. Take advantage of as well idle computation capabilities at the edge.

🔐 **Secure**: Data scrubbing and security can before migration to reduce the chance of leaking private information, and with a far more granular, code-based permission model.

📚 **Large-scale data**: Bacalhau operates on a network of open compute resources made available to serve any data processing workload. With Bacalhau you can batch process petabytes (quadrillion bytes) of data.

## Our Vision

Bacalhau seeks to transform data processing for large-scale datasets to improve cost and efficiency, and to open up data processing to larger audiences. Our goals with the project center around creating an open, collaborative Compute ecosystem. We created Bacalhau to bring useful Compute resources to data stored in Filecoin. We believe that the same benefits of open collaboration on datasets stored in IPFS and Filecoin should be available to generic storage compute tasks.

## Roadmap

Initially, the Bacalhau project will focus on serving data processing and analytics use cases. Over time, Bacalhau will expand to other Compute workloads. You can find Bacalhau's [Public Roadmap here](https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/issues/1151)!
