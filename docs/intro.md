## Overview

Bacalhau is a platform for public, transparent, and optionally verifiable distributed computation. It enables users to run arbitrary Docker containers and WebAssembly (wasm) images as tasks against data stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This architecture is also referred to as **Compute Over Data** (or CoD). _[Bacalhau](https://translate.google.com/?sl=pt&tl=en&text=bacalhau&op=translate) was coined from the Portuguese word for salted Cod fish_.  **At the moment we are free volunteer network, enjoy;)** 

## Why Bacalhau?

- ⚡️ **Process jobs fast**: Jobs in Bacalhau are processed where the data was created and all jobs are parallel by default.
- 💸 **Low cost:** You get to save on ingress/egress fees you encounter whenver you move data around since jobs are processed where the data is created.
- 🔐 **Secure**: Data is not collected in a central location before processing, meaning all scrubbing and security can be applied at the point of collection.
- 📚 **Large-scale data**: Bacalhau operates on a network of open compute resources made available to serve any data processing workload. With Bacalhau you can batch process petabytes (quadrillion bytes) of data.

## Our Vision

Bacalhau seeks to transform data processing for large-scale datasets to improve cost and efficiency, and to open up data processing to larger audiences. Our goals with the project center around creating an open, collaborative Compute ecosystem. We created Bacalhau to bring useful Compute resources to data stored in Filecoin. We believe that the same benefits of open collaboration on datasets stored in IPFS and Filecoin should be available to generic compute tasks.

## Roadmap

Initially, the Bacalhau project will focus on serving data processing and analytics use cases. Over time, Bacalhau will expand to other Compute workloads. You can find Bacalhau's [Public Roadmap here](https://www.starmaps.app/roadmap/github.com/filecoin-project/bacalhau/issues/115)!
