# Command: `job run`

## Description

The `bacalhau job run` command facilitates the initiation of a job from a file or directly from the standard input (stdin). The command supports both JSON and YAML data formats. This command is particularly useful for quickly executing a job without the need for manual configurations.

## Usage

```
bacalhau job run [flags]
```

## Flags

- `--dry-run`:
    - Description: With this flag, the job will not be submitted. Instead, it will display what would have been submitted, providing a way to preview before actual submission.

- `-f`, `--follow`:
    - Description: If provided, the command will continuously display the output from the job as it runs.

- `--id-only`:
    - Description: On successful job submission, only the Job ID will be printed.

- `--no-template`:
    - Disable the templating feature. When this flag is set, the job spec will be used as-is, without any placeholder replacements
  
- `--node-details`:
    - Description: Displays details of all nodes. Note that this flag is overridden if `--id-only` is provided.

- `--show-warnings`:
    - Description: Shows any warnings that occur during the job submission.

- `-E`, `--template-envs`:
    - Specify a regular expression pattern for selecting environment variables to be included as template variables in the job spec.
      e.g. `--template-envs ".*"` will include all environment variables.

- `-V`, `--template-vars`:
    - Replace a placeholder in the job spec with a value. e.g. `--template-vars foo=bar`

- `--wait`:
    - Description: Waits for the job to finish execution. To set this to false, use --wait=false
    - Default: `true`

- `--wait-timeout-secs int`:
    - Description: If `--wait` is provided, this flag sets the maximum time (in seconds) the command will wait for the job to finish before it terminates.
    - Default: `600` seconds

- `-h`, `--help`:
    - Description: Displays help information for the `run` command.

## Global Flags

- `--api-host string`:
    - Description: Specifies the host used for RESTful communication between the client and server. The flag is disregarded if `BACALHAU_API_HOST` environment variable is set.
    - Default: `bootstrap.production.bacalhau.org`

- `--api-port int`:
    - Description: Determines the port for REST communication. If `BACALHAU_API_PORT` environment variable is set, this flag will be ignored.
    - Default: `1234`

## Examples

**Sample Job (`job.yaml`)**

A sample job used in the following examples is provided below:
```bash
cat job.yaml
```

```yaml
name: A Simple Docker Job
type: batch
count: 1
tasks:
  - name: My main task
    engine:
      type: docker
      params:
        Image: ubuntu:latest
        Entrypoint:
          - /bin/bash
        Parameters:
          - -c
          - echo Hello Bacalhau!
```

This configuration describes a batch job that runs a Docker task. It utilizes the `ubuntu:latest` image and executes the command `echo Hello Bacalhau!`.

## Templating
`bacalhau job run` providing users with the ability to dynamically inject variables into their job specifications. This feature is particularly useful when running multiple jobs with varying parameters such as S3 buckets, prefixes, and time ranges without the need to edit each job specification file manually. You can find more information about templating [here](/topic-guides/job-templating.md).
