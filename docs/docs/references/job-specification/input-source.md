# InputSource Specification

An `InputSource` defines where and how to retrieve specific artifacts needed for a [`Task`](task), such as files or data, and where to mount them within the task's context. This ensures the necessary data is present before the task's execution begins.

Bacalhau's `InputSource` natively supports fetching data from remote sources like S3 and IPFS and can also mount local directories. It is intended to be flexible for future expansion.

## `InputSource` Parameters:

- **Source** <code>(<a href="./spec-config">SpecConfig</a> : \<required\>)</code>: Specifies the origin of the artifact, which could be a URL, an S3 bucket, or other locations.

- **Alias** `(string: <optional>)`: An optional identifier for this input source. It's particularly useful for dynamic operations within a task, such as dynamically importing data in WebAssembly using an alias.

- **Target** `(string: <required>)`: Defines the path inside the task's environment where the retrieved artifact should be mounted or stored. This ensures that the task can access the data during its execution.

## Usage Examples
```YAML
InputSources:
  - Source:
      Type: s3
      Params:
        Bucket: my_bucket
        Region: us-west-1
    Target: /my_s3_data
  - Source:
      Type: localDirectory
      Params:
        SourcePath: /path/to/local/directory
        ReadWrite: true
    Target: /my_local_data
```

In this example, the first input source fetches data from an S3 bucket and mounts it at `/my_s3_data` within the task. The second input source mounts a local directory at `/my_local_data` and allows the task to read and write data to it.
