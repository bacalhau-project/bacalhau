# Running a Prolog Script

## Introduction
Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules. A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations.
Prolog is well-suited for specific tasks that benefit from rule-based logical queries such as searching databases, voice control systems, and filling templates.

A quick guide on how to run a hello world script on Bacalhau

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need to install the Bacalhau client, see more information [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation)


## Running Locally​


To get started, install swipl 



```bash
%%bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:swi-prolog/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
```

Create a file called `helloworld.pl`. The following script prints ‘Hello World’ to the stdout



```python
%%writefile helloworld.pl
hello_world :- write('Hello World'), nl, 
               halt.
```

Running the script to print out the output



```bash
%%bash
swipl -q -s helloworld.pl -g hello_world
```

After the script has run successfully locally we can now run it on Bacalhau.  

Before running it on Bacalhau we need to upload it to IPFS.

Using the `IPFS cli`



```python
!wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.4.2/go-ipfs_v0.4.2_linux-amd64.tar.gz
!tar xvfz go-ipfs_v0.4.2_linux-amd64.tar.gz
!mv go-ipfs/ipfs /usr/local/bin/ipfs
!ipfs init
!ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/readme
!ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8082
!ipfs config Addresses.API /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5002
!nohup ipfs daemon > startup.log &
```

Run the command below to check if our script has been uploaded. This commmand outputs the CID.


```python
!ipfs add helloworld.pl
```

Copy the CID of the file which in this case is `QmYq9ipYf3vsj7iLv5C67BXZcpLHxZbvFAJbtj7aKN5qii`

Since the data uploaded To IPFS isn’t pinned, we will need to do that manually. Check this information on how to pin your [data](https://docs.bacalhau.org/data-ingestion/pin) We recommend using [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/).



## Running a Bacalhau Job 


To submit a job, run the following Bacalhau command:


```bash
%%bash --out job_id
bacalhau docker run \
-i ipfs://QmYq9ipYf3vsj7iLv5C67BXZcpLHxZbvFAJbtj7aKN5qii:/helloworld.pl \
--wait \
--id-only \
swipl \
 -- swipl -q -s helloworld.pl -g hello_world
```

### Structure of the Command


`-i: ipfs://< CID >:/< name-of-the-script >`: we will mount the script to the container using the -v flag

`Swipl`: flag

`-q`: running in quiet mode

`-s`: load file as a script in this case we want to run the script helloworld.pl

`-g`: is the name of the function you want to execute in this case its hello_world

When a job is submitted, Bacalhau prints out the related `job_id`. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.

## Checking the State of your Jobs

- **Job status**: You can check the status of the job using `bacalhau list`. 


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID} --wide
```

When it says `Published` or `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

- **Job information**: You can find out more information about your job by using `bacalhau describe`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

- **Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using `bacalhau get`. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.


```bash
%%bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results
bacalhau get $JOB_ID --output-dir results
```

## Viewing your Job Output

To view the file, run the following command:


```bash
%%bash
cat results/stdout
```
