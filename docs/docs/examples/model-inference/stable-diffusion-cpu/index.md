# Stable Diffusion on a CPU


[Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) is a state of the art text-to-image model that generates images from text and was developed as an open-source alternative to [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/). It is based on a [Diffusion Probabilistic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09672) and uses a [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) to generate images from text.

This example demonstrates how to use stable diffusion on a CPU and run it on the [Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/) demo network. The first section describes the development of the code and the container. The second section demonstrates how to run the job using [Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/).

The images presented on this page were generated by this model.

### TL;DR

```bash
bacalhau docker run ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/stable-diffusion-cpu:0.0.1 \
  -- python demo.py \
  --prompt "cod in space" \
  --output ../outputs/cod.png
```



## Development

The [original](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) text-to-image stable diffusion model was trained on a fleet of GPU machines, at great cost. To use this trained model for inference, you also need to run it on a GPU.

However, this isn't always desired or possible. One alternative is to use a project called [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html) from Intel that allows you to convert and optimize models from a variety of frameworks (and ONNX if your framework isn't directly supported) to run on a [supported](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_Working_with_devices.html) Intel CPU. This is what we will do in this example.

:::info
Heads up! This example takes about 10 minutes to generate an image on an average CPU. Whilst this demonstrates it is possible, it might not be practical.
:::

### Prerequisites

In order to run this example you need:

1. A Debian-flavoured Linux (although you [might be able](https://github.com/bfirsh/stable-diffusion/tree/apple-silicon-mps-support) to get it working on M1 macs)
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)


### Converting Stable Diffusion to a CPU Model Using OpenVINO

The first step is to convert the trained stable diffusion models so that they work efficiently on a CPU using OpenVINO. The example is quite complex, so we have created a [separate repository](https://github.com/js-ts/stable_diffusion.openvino) (which is a fork from Github user [Sergei Belousov](https://github.com/bes-dev/stable_diffusion.openvino)) to host the code. 

In summary, the code downloads a [pre-optimized OpenVINO version](https://huggingface.co/bes-dev/stable-diffusion-v1-4-openvino) of the [original](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) pre-trained stable diffusion model, which also leverages OpenAI's [CLIP transformer](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14) and is then wrapped inside an OpenVINO runtime, which reads in and executes the model.

The core code representing these tasks can be found [in the `stable_diffusion_engine.py` file](https://github.com/js-ts/stable_diffusion.openvino/blob/master/stable_diffusion_engine.py). This is a mashup that creates a pipeline necessary to tokenize the text and run the stable diffusion model. This boilerplate could be simplified by leveraging the more recent version of the [diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers). But let's crack on.

### Install Dependencies

Note that these dependencies are only known to work on Ubuntu-based x64 machines.


```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgl1 libglib2.0-0 git-lfs
```

### Clone the Repository and Dependencies

The following commands clone the example repository, and other required repositories, and install the Python dependencies.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/js-ts/stable_diffusion.openvino
cd stable_diffusion.openvino
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14
git clone https://huggingface.co/bes-dev/stable-diffusion-v1-4-openvino
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generating an Image

Now that we have all the dependencies installed, we can call the `demo.py` wrapper, which is a simple CLI, to generate an image from a prompt.


```bash
cd stable_diffusion.openvino && \
  python3 demo.py \
  --prompt "hello" \
  --output hello.png
```

When the generation is complete, you can open the generated `hello.png` and see something like this:

![png](index_files/index_8_0.png)

Lets try another prompt and see what we get:

```bash
cd stable_diffusion.openvino && \
  python3 demo.py \
  --prompt "cat driving a car" \
  --output cat.png
```

## Running Stable Diffusion (CPU) on Bacalhau

Now we have a working example, we can convert it into a format that allows us to perform inference in a distributed environment.

First we will create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the inference code. The Dockerfile [can be found in the repository](https://github.com/js-ts/stable_diffusion.openvino/blob/master/Dockerfile), but is presented here to aid understanding.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9.9-bullseye

WORKDIR /src

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
    libgl1 libglib2.0-0 git-lfs

RUN git lfs install

COPY requirements.txt /src/

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY stable_diffusion_engine.py demo.py demo_web.py /src/
COPY data/ /src/data/

RUN git clone https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14
RUN git clone https://huggingface.co/bes-dev/stable-diffusion-v1-4-openvino

# download models
RUN python3 demo.py --num-inference-steps 1 --prompt "test" --output /tmp/test.jpg
```

This container is using the `python:3.9.9-bullseye` image and the working directory is set. Next, the Dockerfile installs the same dependencies from earlier in this notebook. Then we add our custom code and pull the dependent repositories.

We've already pushed this image to GHCR, but for posterity, you'd use a command like this to update it:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push -t ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/stable-diffusion-cpu:0.0.1 .
```

### Prerequisites

To run this example you will need:

* [Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/) installed and running


### Generating an Image Using Stable Diffusion on Bacalhau

[Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/) is a distributed computing platform that allows you to run jobs on a network of computers. It is designed to be easy to use and to run on a variety of hardware. In this example, we will use it to run the stable diffusion model on a CPU.

To submit a job, you can use the Bacalhau CLI. The following command passes a prompt to the model and generates an image in the outputs directory.

:::tip

This will take about 10 minutes to complete. Go grab a coffee. Or a beer. Or both. If you want to block and wait for the job to complete, add the `--wait` flag.

Furthermore, the container itself is about 15GB, so it might take a while to download on the node if it isn't cached.
:::
### Structure of the command

:::warning
Some of the jobs presented in the Examples section may require more resources than are currently available on the demo network. Consider [starting your own network](../../../setting-up/running-node/) or running less resource-intensive jobs on the demo network
:::

1. `export JOB_ID=$( ... )`: Export results of a command execution as environment variable
1. `bacalhau docker run`: Run a job using docker executor.
1. `--id-only`: Flag to print out only the job id
1. `ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/stable-diffusion-cpu:0.0.1`: The name and the tag of the Docker image.
1. The command to run inference on the model: `python demo.py --prompt "First Humans On Mars" --output ../outputs/mars.png`. It consists of:
    1. `demo.py`: The Python script that runs the inference process.
    1. `--prompt "First Humans On Mars"`: Specifies the text prompt to be used for the inference.
    1. `--output ../outputs/mars.png`: Specifies the path to the output image.

When a job is submitted, Bacalhau prints out the related `job_id`. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.

```bash
export JOB_ID=$(bacalhau docker run \  
ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/stable-diffusion-cpu:0.0.1 \
--id-only \
-- python demo.py --prompt "First Humans On Mars" --output ../outputs/mars.png)
``` 


### Checking the State of your Jobs

1. **Job status**: You can check the status of the job using `bacalhau list`:


```bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID}
```

When it says `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

2. **Job information**: You can find out more information about your job by using `bacalhau describe`:

```bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

3. **Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using `bacalhau get`. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.


```bash
rm -rf results && mkdir results
bacalhau get ${JOB_ID} --output-dir results
```

### Viewing your Job Output

After the download has finished we can see the results in the `results/outputs` folder.
