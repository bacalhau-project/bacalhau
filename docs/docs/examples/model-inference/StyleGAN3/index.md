# Generate Realistic Images using StyleGAN3 and Bacalhau


[![stars - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bacalhau-project/bacalhau?style=social)](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau)

In this example tutorial, we will show you how to generate realistic images with StyleGAN3 and Bacalhau. StyleGAN is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which include a generator and discriminator network that has been trained to differentiate images generated by the generator from real images. However, during the training, the generator tries to fool the discriminator, which results in the generation of realistic-looking images. With StyleGAN3 we can generate realistic-looking images or videos. It can generate not only human faces but also animals, cars, and landscapes.

Generative images with Bacalhau



## Prerequisite


To get started, you need to install the Bacalhau client, see more information [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation)


## Running StyleGAN3 locally

To run StyleGAN3 locally, you'll need to clone the repo, install dependencies and download the model weights.


```bash
%%bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3
cd stylegan3
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate stylegan3
wget https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/research/stylegan3/versions/1/files/stylegan3-r-afhqv2-512x512.pkl
```

Generate an image using a pre-trained `AFHQv2` model

## Containerize Script with Docker

To build your own docker container, create a `Dockerfile`, which contains instructions to build your image.

```
COPY . /scratch

WORKDIR /scratch

ENV HOME /scratch
```


:::info
See more information on how to containerize your script/app[here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/)
:::


### Build the container

We will run `docker build` command to build the container;

```
docker build -t <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag> .
```

Before running the command replace;

- **hub-user** with your docker hub username, If you donâ€™t have a docker hub account [follow these instructions to create docker account](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/), and use the username of the account you created

- **repo-name** with the name of the container, you can name it anything you want

- **tag** this is not required but you can use the latest tag

In our case

```bash
docker build -t jsacex/stylegan3 
```

### Push the container

Next, upload the image to the registry. This can be done by using the Docker hub username, repo name or tag.

```
docker push <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag>
```

In our case

```bash
docker push jsacex/stylegan3 
```


## Running a Bacalhau Job

To submit a job, run the following Bacalhau command:



```bash
%%bash --out job_id
bacalhau docker run \
--wait \
--id-only \
--gpu 1 \
--timeout 3600 \
--wait-timeout-secs 3600 \
jsacex/stylegan3 \
-- python gen_images.py --outdir=../outputs --trunc=1 --seeds=2 --network=stylegan3-r-afhqv2-512x512.pkl
```

### Structure of the command

Let's look closely at the command above:

* `bacalhau docker run`: call to bacalhau

* `--gpu 1`: No of GPUs

* `jsacex/stylegan3`: the name and the tag of the docker image we are using

* `../outputs`: path to the output

* `python gen_images.py`: execute the script

* `--trunc=1 --seeds=2 --network=stylegan3-r-afhqv2-512x512.pkl`: The animation length is either determined based on the --seeds value or explicitly specified using the --num-keyframes option. When num keyframes are specified with --num-keyframes, the output video length will be 'num_keyframes*w_frames' frames.


### Render a latent vector interpolation video

You can also run variations of this command to generate videos and other things. In the following command below, we will render a latent vector interpolation video. This will render a 4x2 grid of interpolations for seeds 0 through 31.


```bash
%%bash --out job_id
bacalhau docker run \
jsacex/stylegan3 \
--gpu 1 \
--timeout 3600 \
--wait-timeout-secs 3600 \
-- python gen_video.py --output=../outputs/lerp.mp4 --trunc=1 --seeds=0-31 --grid=4x2 --network=stylegan3-r-afhqv2-512x512.pkl
```

### Structure of the command

Let's look closely at the command above:

* `bacalhau docker run`: call to bacalhau

* `--gpu 1`: No of GPUs

* `jsacex/stylegan3`: the name and the tag of the docker image we are using

* `../outputs`: path to the output

* `python gen_images.py`: execute the script

* `--trunc=1 --seeds=2 --network=stylegan3-r-afhqv2-512x512.pkl`: The animation length is either determined based on the _--seeds_ value or explicitly specified using the _--num-keyframes_ option. When num keyframes is specified with _--num-keyframes_, the output video length will be 'num_keyframes*w_frames' frames. If _--num-keyframes_ is not specified, the number of seeds given with  _--seeds_ must be divisible by grid size W*H (--grid).  In this case, the output video length will be '# seeds/(w*h)*w_frames' frames.

When a job is submitted, Bacalhau prints out the related `job_id`. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.


```python
%env JOB_ID={job_id}
```

## Checking the State of your Jobs

- **Job status**: You can check the status of the job using `bacalhau list`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID} --wide
```

When it says `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

- **Job information**: You can find out more information about your job by using `bacalhau describe`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

- **Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using `bacalhau get`. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.


```bash
%%bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results
bacalhau get $JOB_ID --output-dir results
```

After the download has finished you should see the following contents in the results directory

## Viewing your Job Output

To view the file, run the following command:


```bash
%%bash
ls results/outputs
```


```python
import IPython.display as display
display.Image("results/outputs/seed0002.png")
```
