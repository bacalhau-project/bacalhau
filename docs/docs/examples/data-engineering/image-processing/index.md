# Simple Image Processing


[![stars - badge-generator](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bacalhau-project/bacalhau?style=social)](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau)

In this example tutorial, we will show you how to use Bacalhau to process images on a [Landsat dataset](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeZRGhe4PmjctYVSVHuEiA9oSXnqmYa4kQubSHgWbjv72/). 

Bacalhau has the unique capability of operating at a massive scale in a distributed environment. This is made possible because data is naturally sharded across the IPFS network amongst many providers. We can take advantage of this to process images in parallel.

Processing of images from a dataset using Bacalhau

## Prerequisite

To get started, you need to install the Bacalhau client, see more information [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation)


```python
!command -v bacalhau >/dev/null 2>&1 || (export BACALHAU_INSTALL_DIR=.; curl -sL https://get.bacalhau.org/install.sh | bash)
path=!echo $PATH
%env PATH=./:{path[0]}
```

## Running a Bacalhau Job

To submit a workload to Bacalhau, we will use the `bacalhau docker run` command. 


```bash
%%bash --out job_id
bacalhau docker run \
  --wait \
  --wait-timeout-secs 100 \
  --id-only \
  -i ipfs://QmeZRGhe4PmjctYVSVHuEiA9oSXnqmYa4kQubSHgWbjv72:/input_images \
  dpokidov/imagemagick:7.1.0-47-ubuntu \
  -- magick mogrify -resize 100x100 -quality 100 -path /outputs '/input_images/*.jpg'
```

The job has been submitted and Bacalhau has printed out the related job id. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.


```python
%env JOB_ID={job_id}
```

    env: JOB_ID=bf785b4d-dcac-4f4a-9c63-cf9906aa2941


The `bacalhau docker run` command allows to pass input data volume with a `-i ipfs://CID:path` argument just like Docker, except the left-hand side of the argument is a [content identifier (CID)](https://github.com/multiformats/cid). This results in Bacalhau mounting a *data volume* inside the container. By default, Bacalhau mounts the input volume at the path `/inputs` inside the container.

Bacalhau also mounts a data volume to store output data. The `bacalhau docker run` command creates an output data volume mounted at `/outputs`. This is a convenient location to store the results of your job. 

## Checking the State of your Jobs

- **Job status**: You can check the status of the job using `bacalhau list`. 


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau list --id-filter=${JOB_ID} --no-style
```

     CREATED   ID        JOB                      STATE      VERIFIED  PUBLISHED               
     00:26:44  bf785b4d  Docker dpokidov/imag...  Completed            ipfs://QmQnern37ueHr... 


When it says `Published` or `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

- **Job information**: You can find out more information about your job by using `bacalhau describe`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

- **Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using `bacalhau get`. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.


```bash
%%bash
rm -rf results && mkdir results # Temporary directory to store the results
bacalhau get ${JOB_ID} --output-dir results # Download the results
```

After the download has finished you should see the following contents in results directory.

## Viewing your Job Output

To view the file, run the following command:


```bash
%%bash
ls -lah results/outputs
```

### Display the image

To view the images, we will use **glob** to return all file paths that match a specific pattern. 


```python
import glob
from IPython.display import Image, display
for imageName in glob.glob('results/outputs/*.jpg'):
    display(Image(filename=imageName))
```
