# Authentication and authorization

Bacalhau includes a flexible auth system that supports multiple methods of auth
that are appropriate for different deployment environments.

## By default

With no specific authentication configuration supplied, Bacalhau runs in
"anonymous mode" – which allows unidentified users limited control over the
system. "Anonymous mode" is only appropriate for testing or evaluation setups.

In anonymous mode, Bacalhau will allow:

1. Users identified by a self-generated private key to submit any job, cancel their own jobs, read job lists and describing jobs.
1. Users not identified by any key to access other read-only endpoints, such as node or agent information.

## Restricting anonymous access

Bacalhau auth is controlled by policies. Configuring the auth system is done by
supplying a different policy file.

Restricting API access to only users that have authenticated requires specifying
a new **authorization policy**. You can download a policy that restricts
anonymous access and install it by using:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/main/pkg/authz/policies/policy_ns_anon.rego -o ~/.bacalhau/no-anon.rego
bacalhau config set Node.Auth.AccessPolicyPath ~/.bacalhau/no-anon.rego
```

Once the node is restarted, accessing the node APIs will require the user to be
authenticated, but by default will still allow users with a self-generated key
to authenticate themselves.

Please consider that the API is also used when interacting with the Bacalhau network via the CLI

Restricting the list of keys that can authenticate to only a known set requires
specifying a new **authentication policy**. You can download a policy that
restricts key-based access and install it by using:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/main/pkg/authn/challenge/challenge_ns_no_anon.rego -o ~/.bacalhau/challenge_ns_no_anon.rego
bacalhau config set Node.Auth.Methods.ClientKey.Type challenge
bacalhau config set Node.Auth.Methods.ClientKey.PolicyPath ~/.bacalhau/challenge_ns_no_anon.rego
```

Then, modify the `allowed_clients` variable in `challange_ns_no_anon.rego` to
include acceptable client IDs, found by running `bacalhau id`.

```bash
bacalhau id | jq -rc .ClientID
```

Once the node is restarted, only keys in the allowed list will be able to access
any API.

## Username and password access

Users can authenticate using a username and password instead of specifying a
private key for access. Again, this requires installation of an appropriate
policy on the server.

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/main/pkg/authn/ask/ask_ns_password.rego -o ~/.bacalhau/ask_ns_password.rego
bacalhau config set Node.Auth.Methods.Password.Type ask
bacalhau config set Node.Auth.Methods.Password.PolicyPath ~/.bacalhau/ask_ns_password.rego
```

Then the server owner needs to make up usernames and passwords, then generate a random salt. This way the passwords are not stored as plain text. The downloaded policy
expects password hashes and salts generated by `scrypt`. To generate a salted
password, the helper script in `pkg/authn/ask/gen_password` can be used:

```bash
cd pkg/authn/ask/gen_password && go run .
```

This will ask for a password and generate a salt and hash to authenticate with
it. After that add the encoded username, salt and hash into the `ask_ns_password.rego` and provide users with their credentials.
