# Bacalhau FAQs

### Can I use multiple data sources in the same job?
You can use the `--input` or `-i` flag multiple times with multiple different CIDs, URLs or S3 objects, and give each of them a path to be mounted at. 

For example, doing `bacalhau run cat/main.wasm -i ipfs://CID1:/input1 -i ipfs://CID2:/input2` will result in both the `input1` and `input2` folders being available to your running WASM with the CID contents. You can use `-i` as many times as you need. 

### How can I submit Job requests through CLI to communicate with my Node directly?

To ensure the CLI can communicate with our node directly (`bacalhau --api-host <MY_NODE_PUBLIC_IP> version`), you need to make sure the **1234** port is open.

### Why does my API server listening on `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001` when I invoke IPFS Daemon when fetching an IPFS Multiaddress?

Bacalhau communicates with IPFS via it's API port and not the swarm port which is why it's **5001** and not **4001**.

The key thing is whether the IPFS node is running on the same host as the Bacalhau daemon. If it is, then **127.0.0.1** is enough to route traffic between the two (because they are both on the same node). If IPFS is running on a different node than Bacalhau, then we need to replace **127.0.0.1** with the IP that the IPFS server is running on.

### What to do when I get error connection refused when running Bacalhau API?

#### Problem
When running `bacalhau --api-host <MY_NODE_PUBLIC_IP> version`  and you get this error message: 

```bash
Error running version: publicapi: after posting request: Post "http://127.0.0.1:1234/version": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:1234: connect: connection refused
```

#### What to do
First, you'll need to check that the bacalhau server is up and running on the same host then it should be connecting using `127.0.0.1`. This can be checked by running `telnet 127.0.0.1 1234`. If telnet is not connecting to **127.0.0.1 1234** on the machine that bacalhau is running then one of 3 things:

- Bacalhau is running on a different machine
- it's running on a different port
- it's not running

### Can I run Bacalhau in a containerized setup (nested containers)?

We don't support this as it will result in the classic Dind(Docker In Docker) problem. 

### Can I run non Docker jobs?

Yes! You can run programs using WebAssembly instead. See the [onboarding WebAssembly](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/wasm-workload-onboarding) for information on how to do that.

### How do I run a script that requires installing packages from a package repository like pypi or apt?

Networking is supported by Bacalhau which enables one to run a script that requires packages from external repository. This is only for Docker workloads

## How do I see a job’s progress while it’s running?

If your job writes to stdout, or stderr, while it is running, you can view the output with the [logs](https://docs.bacalhau.org/all-flags/#logs) command.

## How do I get an IPFS peer if I want to start Bacalhau Server?

A viable option is to run your own IPFS daemon and fetch your multiaddress as explained [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/running-node/quick-start/#ensure-ipfs-is-running).

## How can I download and query SQLite when it complains about being in read-only directory?

When downloading content to run your code against, it is written to a read-only directory. Unfortunately, by default, SQLite requires the directory to be writable so that it can create utility files during its use.

If you run your command with the `immutable` setting set to 1, then it will work. From the sqlite3 command you can use `.open 'file:/inputs/database.db?immutable=1'` where you should replace "database.db" with your downloaded database filename.

## Can I run bacalhau serve on my home machine? What are the requirements?

You can run `bacalhau serve` on any machine that fits the prerequisites listed [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/running-node/quick-start/). 

:::tip
The walkthrough in the docs has been tested only on Ubuntu 22, bacalhau is being developed on Linux/macOS environments and therefore should work fine there as well. However, Windows hosts are supported with [limitations](https://docs.bacalhau.org/running-node/windows-support/).

## Can I stop a running job?

Yes. Given a valid job ID, you can use the [cancel command](https://docs.bacalhau.org/all-flags#cancel) to cancel the job,
and stop it from running.
