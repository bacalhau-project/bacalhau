# Observability for WebAssembly Workloads in Bacalhau

Gain deeper insights into the WebAssembly (Wasm) jobs running on Bacalhau compute nodes using the 
[Observe SDK](https://dev.dylibso.com/docs/category/observe-sdk/), an open-source library that unlocks modern observability for WebAssembly. This feature supplements the [host-level observability](/running-node/observability/) data with additional traces extracted from within the Wasm modules running on compute nodes in a Bacalhau network.

## Features
- Extract telemetry data from Wasm workloads. Currently supports tracing, with logs and metrics coming soon.
- Data can be sent to the [same viewing destinations](/running-node/observability/#viewing) (ie. sinks) that are supported for the host-level data.
- Utilizes the same Trace ID as the host-level data, allowing for seamless visibility into the end-to-end execution of the job.

## Installing the SDK

- The Observe SDK is integrated with the default WebAssembly [Executor](/getting-started/architecture/#executor) provided by Bacalhau, so node operators are not required to integrate the SDK itself as long as a custom / pluggable Executor is not being used.
- *(Optional)* For node operators using a custom Executer see [here](https://dev.dylibso.com/docs/observe/adapters/golang/opentelemetry) for instructions on how to integrate the Observe SDK.
- The SDK uses the same environment variables noted [here](/running-node/observability/#viewing) for sending data out to a viewing destination.

## Usage

If you are running a Wasm-based workload on the Bacalhau network, your module must be instrumented in order to send its telemetry data to the [host interfaces](https://github.com/dylibso/observe-sdk/tree/main/observe-api) provided by the Observe SDK. Modules can be instrumented **automatically** or **manually**.

### Automatic Instrumentation

Wasm modules can be automatically instrumented using an [instrumentation compiler](https://dev.dylibso.com/docs/observe/instrumentation/automatic/) provided by [Dylibso](https://dylibso.com/). This method removes the need for manual instrumentation (see below) but does not preclude it (ie. both methods can be used together without issue)

### Manual Instrumentation

In order to manually instrument a Wasm module, calls are made to the [Observe API](https://github.com/dylibso/observe-sdk/tree/main/observe-api) function interfaces through language bindings specific to the source language used to create the Wasm module. Examples of these bindings are available for [C](https://github.com/dylibso/observe-sdk/blob/main/observe-api/test/c/main.c) and [Rust](https://github.com/dylibso/observe-sdk/blob/main/observe-api/test/rust/src/main.rs). Additional language bindings are planned but you can also build your own if desired. If going the former route, Dylibso can [assist](https://dev.dylibso.com/support).

Note: Currently, only the `span_enter`, `span_exit`, and `span_tag` interfaces are implemented, with support for logging and metrics available in the future.
