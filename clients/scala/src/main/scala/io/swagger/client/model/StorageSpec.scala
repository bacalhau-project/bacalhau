/**
 * @param CID The unique ID of the data, where it makes sense (for example, in an IPFS storage spec this will be the data's CID). NOTE: The below is capitalized to match IPFS & IPLD (even though it's out of golang fmt) for example: '''QmTVmC7JBD2ES2qGPqBNVWnX1KeEPNrPGb7rJ8cpFgtefe'''
 * @param metadata Additional properties specific to each driver
 * @param name Name of the spec's data, for reference. for example: '''job-9304c616-291f-41ad-b862-54e133c0149e-shard-0-host-QmdZQ7ZbhnvWY1J12XYKGHApJ6aufKyLNSvf8jZBrBaAVL'''
 * @param storageSource StorageSource is the abstract source of the data. E.g. a storage source might be a URL download, but doesn't specify how the execution engine does the download or what it will do with the downloaded data.
 * @param URL Source URL of the data
 * @param `path` The path that the spec's data should be mounted on, where it makes sense (for example, in a Docker storage spec this will be a filesystem path). TODO: #668 Replace with \"Path\" (note the caps) for yaml/json when we update the n.js file
