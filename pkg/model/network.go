	NetworkNone Network = iota

	// NetworkFull specifies that the job requires unfiltered raw IP networking.
	NetworkFull

	// NetworkHTTP specifies that the job requires HTTP networking to certain domains.
	//
	// The model is: the job specifier submits a job with the domain(s) it will
	// need to communicate with, the compute provider uses this to make some
	// decision about the risk of the job and bids accordingly, and then at run
	// time the traffic is limited to only the domain(s) specified.
	//
	// As a command, something like:
	//
	//  bacalhau docker run —network=http —domain=crates.io —domain=github.com -v Qmy1234myd4t4:/code rust/compile
	//
	// The “risk” for the compute provider is that the job does something that
	// violates its terms, the terms of its hosting provider or ISP, or even the
	// law in its jurisdiction (e.g. accessing and spreading illegal content,
	// performing cyberattacks). So the same sort of risk as operating a Tor
	// exit node.
	//
	// The risk for the job specifier is that we are operating in an environment
	// they are paying for, so there is an incentive to hijack that environment
	// (e.g. via a compromised package download that runs a crypto miner on
	// install, and uses up all the paid-for job time). Having the traffic
	// enforced to only domains specified makes those sorts of attacks much
	// trickier and less valuable.
	//
	// The compute provider might well enforce its limits by other means, but
	// having the domains specified up front allows it to skip bidding on jobs
	// it knows will fail in its executor. So this is hopefully a better UX for
	// job specifiers who can have their job picked up only by someone who will
	// run it successfully.
