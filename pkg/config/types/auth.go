	// name is a human-readable string chosen by the person configuring the

	// *type* but with different configs and parameters, each identified with a
	// unique method name.

	// For example, if an implementation wants to allow users to log in with
	// Github or Bitbucket, they might both use an authenticator implementation
	// of type "oidc", and each would appear once on this provider with key /
	// method name "github" and "bitbucket".

	// authentication via client keys will be enabled.

	// unauthenticated users (the default as of v1.2.0) will be used.
