// This method allows errors to implement extra interfaces (above) to do
// "attribute-based error reporting". The design principle is that errors can
// report a set of extra flags that have well defined semantics which the system
// can then respond to with specific behavior. This allows introducing or
// refactoring error types without higher-level components needing to be
// modified â€“ they simply continue to respond to the presence of attributes.
//
// This is instead of the sysetm having a centralized set of known error types
// and programming in specific behavior in response to them, which is brittle
// and requires updating all of the error responses when the types change.
