// touchfs implements an FS.fs that will create any files that don't exist when
// they are accessed.
//
// This is necessary because our WASM implementation takes an fs.FS as an
// interface to a filesystem but the filesystem-backed FS returned by os.DirFS
// is read-only by default and will return an os.ErrNotExist if a file is opened
// for writing for the first time.
//
// To do this, touchfs tracks a directory prefix (as a string) which is both
// where it will serve and create files. Deeply nested directories are not
// supported, i.e. calling Open('a/b/c') where 'b' does not exist will sitll
// throw an error.
//
// This is really a limitation of the fs.FS interface and wazero shoudn't be
// using it to provide a writable filesystem.
