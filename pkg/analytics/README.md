1. **Execution Identification**
    - **Execution ID**: A unique identifier for the execution.
    - **Job ID**: The identifier for the associated job.
    - **Evaluation ID**: An identifier linking the execution to its evaluation process.
    - **Node Name Hash**: A hashed version of the name of the node where the execution is running.
    - **Namespace Hash**: A hashed version of the namespace under which the execution is running.
2. **Execution Metadata**
    - **Execution Name Set**: Whether a specific name was set for the execution.
    - **Previous & Next Executions**: Links to any preceding or subsequent executions, if applicable.
    - **Follow-up Evaluation ID**: An identifier for any follow-up evaluations related to the execution.
    - **Revision**: A version number that tracks changes to the execution configuration over time.
    - **Creation & Modification Times**: Timestamps indicating when the execution was created and last modified.
3. **Resource Allocation**
    - **Total CPU Units**: The total CPU resources allocated for the execution.
    - **Total Memory, Disk, and GPU Usage**: The memory, disk space, and GPU resources used by the execution.
4. **Execution States**
    - **Desired State:** The intended state of the execution (e.g., running, completed).
    - **Compute State & Message**: The actual state of the execution, including any details about its progress or errors.
    - **Compute Error Code**: An error code related to any issues with the execution's state on the compute node.
5. **Published Results**
    - **Published Result Type**: The type of result produced by the execution, such as output files or data.
6. **Run Command Results**
    - **Run Output Details**: Information about the command’s execution, including:
        - **Exit Code**: The exit code returned by the executed task (typically 0 for success).
        - **RunResultStdoutTruncated**: Whether stdout was truncated during execution.
        - **RunResultStderrTruncated**: Whether stderr was truncated during execution.

# How do users opt out of sharing data?

To opt out of sharing data, users may run one of the following commands before starting their bacalhau node:
**Disable collection via `config set`**

```bash
bacalhau config set DisableAnalytics true
```

**Disable collection via environment variable**

```bash
export BACALHAU_DISABLEANALYTICS=true
```

**Disable collection via editing the config file**

```bash
echo 'disableanalytics: true' >> ~/.bacalhau/config.yaml
```

**Disable collection via a config flag**

```bash
bacalhau --config=DisableAnalytics=true <command>
```

## **How can users verify they have opted out?**

```bash
bacalhau config list | grep disableanalytics
```

Expected output when collection is disabled:

```bash
disableanalytics  true  No description available                                                         
```

Expected output when collection is enabled:

```bash
disableanalytics  false  No description available                                                         
```
