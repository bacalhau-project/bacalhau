/*
Package scenario provides a high-level testing framework for running Bacalhau
jobs in different configurations and making assertions against the results.

The unit of measure is the `Scenario` which decsribes a Bacalhau network, a job
to be submitted to it, and a set of checks to exercise that the job was executed
as expected.

Scenarios can be used in standalone way (see `pkg/test/executor/test_runner.go`)
or using the provided `ScenarioRunner` can be used.

As well as executing jobs against real executors, a Scenario can instead use the
NoopExecutor to implement a mocked out job. This makes is easier to test network
features without needing to invent a real job.
