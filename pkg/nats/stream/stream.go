Package stream provides a NATS client for streaming records between clients with asynchronous
response handling.

Overview:

This package implements a client leveraging NATS for sending and receiving streaming data records.
It abstracts NATS connections, subscriptions, and message handling complexities, offering a
simplified interface for data streaming. The client supports multiplexing multiple streams over a
single NATS subscription, handling responses from different streams using a unique token-based
mechanism. Additionally, the package introduces a Writer component, designed to abstract the
complexities of data encoding and NATS publishing into a simple, intuitive interface.

How It Works:

  - The Client part of the package manages dynamic inboxes for each streaming session, facilitating
    the sending of data and listening for responses on dedicated subjects. It leverages the NATS
    publish-subscribe model for asynchronous communication, efficiently routing and correlating
    messages to their respective streams.

  - The Writer component allows for easy publishing of structured data to any NATS subject. It
    integrates tightly with the Client, utilizing the same connection for streamlined data streaming.
    The Writer simplifies the publication process, automatically handling data serialization and
    supporting graceful stream closure with custom codes.

Multiplexing Streams:

To efficiently handle multiple streams, the client uses a single wildcard subscription for all
responses. Each request is sent with a unique response subject (derived from a base inbox prefix),
with responses routed back to this subject. The client demultiplexes incoming messages by extracting
a token from the response subject, identifying the correct stream (or "bucket") for the message.
This approach allows managing multiple concurrent streams with minimal overhead, leveraging NATS's
lightweight subjects and messaging capabilities.

Key Features:

  - Asynchronous Streaming: Supports asynchronous data streaming, allowing clients to send data and
    receive responses without blocking.

  - Context Support: Integrates with Go's context package for timeouts, cancellation, and deadlines
    for streaming requests.

  - Multiplexing: Efficiently multiplexes multiple streams over a single NATS subscription, using
    unique response subjects for message correlation.

  - Error Handling: Provides robust error handling, including custom error codes for stream-related
    errors (e.g., bad data, normal closure).

  - Data Publication: The Writer simplifies structured data publishing to NATS, with support for
    automatic serialization and stream closure signals.

Usage:

Initialize the client with a NATS connection and use the provided methods to send streaming requests
and handle responses. The client manages the NATS subscription and response routing, simplifying the
process of working with streaming data.

Example:

	params := stream.ClientParams{Conn: natsConn}
	client, err := stream.NewClient(params)
	if err != nil {
	    log.Fatal(err)
	}

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	responseChan, err := client.OpenStream(ctx, "subject", []byte("data"))
	if err != nil {
	    log.Fatal(err)
	}

	for asyncResult := range responseChan {
	    if asyncResult.Err != nil {
	        log.Printf("Received an error: %v", asyncResult.Err)
	        continue
	    }
	    log.Printf("Received data: %s", asyncResult.Value)
	}

This package leverages the concurrency.AsyncResult type for handling asynchronous responses,
allowing clients to distinguish between successful data responses and error conditions.

Note: This client is designed for use with NATS and requires an established NATS connection to
function. It does not handle NATS connection management, which must be performed separately by
the user.
