// EvaluationBroker is used to manage brokering of evaluations. When an evaluation is
// created, due to a change in a job specification or a node, we put it into the
// broker. The broker sorts by evaluations by priority and job type. This
// allows us to dequeue the highest priority work first, while also allowing sub-schedulers
// to only dequeue work they know how to handle.
//
// The broker must provide at-least-once delivery semantics. It relies on explicit
// Ack/Nack messages to handle this. If a delivery is not Ack'd in a sufficient time
// span, it will be assumed Nack'd.
//
// The broker must also make sure there is a single inflight evaluation per job, and that
// multiple enqueued evaluations for the same job can be represented as a single most recent evaluation,
