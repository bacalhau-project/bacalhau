        - Node: QmRaGLzYxM3gsoViokmjt3KFDCJubBzzec1fkJnZjUwDch
          State: Waiting
          Status: ""
          ResultID: ""

obvious scenarios
1. goroutine running container somehow got stuck or the container never quit
2. message got dropped (libp2p isn't reliable, probably doesn't guarantee delivery?)

LocalEvents:
    - Event: Selected
      TargetNode: ""
    - Event: Bid
      TargetNode: ""

seems likely
