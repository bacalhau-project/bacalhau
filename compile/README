This directory contains data used by the Makefile and CI system to allow
cross-compilation under CGO.

Each directory spcifies a host OS and each file within the directory specifies a
target that can be cross-compiled using that host OS. Each file can optionally
specify:

PACKAGES – list of packages to be installed by the host-specific package manager
           prior to do this cross-compilation.

CC – compiler that should be used to do the cross-compilation, which should be
     on the PATH.

Not specifying these just means that cross-compilation is possible with the
default toolchain. (For example, on Apple platforms the native tools can compile
for both amd64 and arm64 targets.)

Note that files only need to exist to enable *cross*-compilation – when
compiling for the same platform as the host, these files are not checked.
